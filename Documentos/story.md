They’ve focused on advancing their knowledge in light magic, becoming masters in healing arts and defensive techniques. About two hundred years ago, an attempted invasion by the Eldreth drove the Lumara to create a hidden city surrounded by impenetrable light barriers. While this has led them to become somewhat isolated, recent developments have pushed some among them to consider opening up once more to form alliances.

In the last half-millennium, the Eldreth faced numerous incursions due to their resource-rich land.

- **Climate**: Volatile—alternates between periods of calm skies filled with ozone scent followed quickly by violent storms  

#### Architecture Characteristics 
Volarith structures are aerodynamic—designed specifically to withstand frequent storms. Homes are crafted within caves on tall cliff faces, ensuring safety from the elements. Windmills fitted with lightning rods capture electrical energy, used to power their relatively advanced technology. Structures have conductive pathways that channel lightning away safely, and aesthetic designs mimic the electric patterns found in nature.  

#### Idiosyncrasy of the Race 
The Volarith are fiercely independent yet highly competitive. They thrive on challenges, both mental and physical. Their society is built on merit, where individuals earn respect and status through skill and intelligence. Their lightning-based magic grants them split-second decision-making abilities and unmatched swiftness in combat, giving them an edge in both individual duels and larger battles.  

#### Cultural Characteristics

#### Religion Characteristics 
The Volarith revere "Stratos," the deity of storms and electricity. Rituals are held during thunderstorms, where ceremonial dances and offerings are made to invoke Stratos's blessing. Temples are situated on high cliffs to be closer to the storm-filled skies, acting as conduits for divine energy.  

#### Type of Government 
Meritocratic Council – A governing body made up of the most skilled and intelligent individuals who have proven themselves through a series of rigorous trials. Leadership positions are contested in electrifying tournaments held under the stormiest skies.  

#### Story of the Race (Last 500 years) 
Over the last five centuries, the Volarith have maintained their dominance over their stormy territories through a combination of tactical prowess and unmatched mastery of lightning-based runes. Approximately 300 years ago, a cataclysmic event known as "The Great Tempest" nearly wiped out their civilization, leading to a period of intense rebuilding and innovation. During this time, they perfected their electrical runes and technology, transforming their society into a beacon of both power and resilience.  Rivalries with both the Lumara and Eldreth have flared up intermittently due to resource disputes and historical grievances, but the Volarith’s strategic advantage often deters prolonged conflicts. In recent years, younger generations have begun exploring the idea of alliances, aiming to harness combined magical strengths for mutual benefits, but old resentments still cast long shadows over these initiatives.


### Story Overview  
In the land of Riondas, a dark power has begun to rise, a secret organization known as the **Umbra Covenant** is conspiring to dominate the three realms of Lumara, Eldreth, and Volarith. Their weapon: an ancient form of dark rune magic, long thought extinct. In this world of deep-seated resentments and historical grievances, a small group of unlikely heroes must unite to thwart this sinister threat.
